# Employee Salary Program and Node.js Integration

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. *Employee Salary Program (Module):* A modularized program written in a language of your choice (let's assume it's Python for this example) to manage and calculate employee salaries.

2. *Node.js Application:* An application built using Node.js that utilizes the Employee Salary Program module to handle employee-related functionalities.

## Employee Salary Program (Module)

### Description

The Employee Salary Program module is designed to manage employee information and calculate their salaries based on specified parameters.

### Features

- Employee data management
- Salary calculation based on customizable parameters
- Modular and easy-to-use design

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-salary-module.git
    

2. Integrate the module into your project:

    python
    from employee_salary_module import Employee, SalaryCalculator

    # Create employee objects
    employee1 = Employee("John Doe", 30, "Software Engineer")
    employee2 = Employee("Jane Smith", 28, "Data Scientist")

    # Calculate salaries
    calculator = SalaryCalculator()
    salary1 = calculator.calculate_salary(employee1)
    salary2 = calculator.calculate_salary(employee2)

    print(f"{employee1.name}'s salary: ${salary1}")
    print(f"{employee2.name}'s salary: ${salary2}")
    

## Node.js Application

### Description

The Node.js application utilizes the Employee Salary Program module to integrate employee management and salary calculation into a web-based platform.

### Features

- RESTful API for employee management
- Integration with the Employee Salary Program module
- Web interface for easy interaction

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-employee-app.git
    

2. Install dependencies:

    bash
    cd nodejs-employee-app
    npm install
    

3. Run the application:

    bash
    npm start
    

4. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
